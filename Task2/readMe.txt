1.Test Case 123(Test_123.py) and Test Case 456(test_456) can be run individually.
2.Baseclass.py has to be kept in the same folder as the test cases
3.separate logs files will be created for the 2 test cases.

comments:
-Config.ini file can be created to keep the standard inputs, which can later be accessed from the test case
 for their required inputs.
-When more Test cases are added separate folder for test cases can be created
-A folder for all the common modules can be created
-Reports of the executed testcases can be created and once automation execution is complete reports can be generated and 
 sent to team via email

***NOTE: I also found the task2 alternative interesting , so I have automated a simple testcase of search engine with the
following flow:
- Launch Chrome and maximize the window
-Open Duckduckgo.com(search engine like google)
-Search for the required keyword
-On the results page verify whether the search box has the keyword 
-verify whether the results are relevant to the searched keyword
I could not document the testcase.
 
Script for the same can be found in Task2 alternative folder ***
